To run Msizap.exe, you need to open a command prompt as administrator. To do this, click on the Start button and type "cmd" in the search box. Right-click on the Command Prompt icon and select "Run as administrator". If prompted by User Account Control, click "Yes".
 
## Step 3: Use Msizap.exe with Appropriate Options
 
Msizap.exe has several options that you can use to remove Windows Installer information for a specific product, all products, or other components. You can view the syntax and options by typing "msizap /?" in the command prompt. Here are some examples of how to use Msizap.exe:
 
- To remove all information for a product with a known product code, type "msizap T product code" (without quotes). For example, "msizap T 90120000-0011-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE" would remove all information for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007.
- To remove all information for a product with an .msi file, type "msizap T <msi package="">" (without quotes). For example, "msizap T C:\Users\John\Downloads\setup.msi" would remove all information for the product installed by setup.msi.</msi>
- To remove all information for all products installed on the computer, type "msizap \* ALLPRODUCTS" (without quotes). This will also remove any cached Windows Installer data files that have been orphaned, rollback information, and In-Progress keys.
- To remove only cached Windows Installer data files that have been orphaned for all users, type "msizap G" (without quotes).
- To remove only rollback information for all users, type "msizap S" (without quotes).
- To remove only In-Progress keys for all users, type "msizap P" (without quotes).

Note that some options may require that the user's profile be loaded so that the user's per-user registry hive be available. You can use the W option to specify that Msizap should remove Windows Installer information for all users. For example, "msizap TW ALLPRODUCTS" would remove all information for all products installed on the computer for all users.
 
## Step 4: Restart Your Computer
 
After using Msizap.exe, you may need to restart your computer to complete the removal process. This will also ensure that any changes made by Msizap are reflected in the system.
 
## Conclusion
 
Msizap.exe is a useful tool that can help you remove Windows Installer information on Windows 7. However, you should use it with caution as it may cause some products to stop working or prevent future updates. Always backup your registry and data before using Msizap.exe and follow the instructions carefully.
